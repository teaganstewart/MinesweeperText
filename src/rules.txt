The aim in Minesweeper is to reveal every tile that is NOT a mine. Once you reveal your first 
tile, you will see a number. Each tiles number represents the number of bombs in the eight(8)
tiles adjacent to that tile. Each tile contains one(1) bomb. You use these numbers to 
determine what tiles are clear and can be revealed. Tiles you think are mines can be marked
using flags. If you reveal a tile that is a bomb, you lose. The aim in the game is to reveal
every non-bomb tile, once you do, you win!

Each round you will be able to flag or reveal a tile. tiles are represented by a letter 
then a number, for example 'a7'. To reveal the tile a7 type 'Ra7' into the console, to
flag it type 'Fa7'.
